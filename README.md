# 👨‍💻 Software Engineer

I build correct, performant, and maintainable applications across web, API, desktop, mobile, and systems-level platforms, grounded in strong foundations in computer science, software architecture, and algorithm design.

My work emphasizes clear reasoning, scalability, and long-term reliability, informed by hands-on experience with algorithms, data structures, operating systems concepts, networking fundamentals, and low-level systems development. I am comfortable working across macOS, Linux, and Windows, including scripting and automation in batch-oriented environments.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to technically rigorous projects and grow within a strong engineering team.
