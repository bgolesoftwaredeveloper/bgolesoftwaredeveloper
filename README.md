# 👨‍💻 Software Engineer

I am a Software Engineer with a strong foundation in computer science, software architecture, and algorithm design.  
I build robust, scalable applications across **Web**, **API**, **Desktop**, **Mobile**, and **Systems-level** environments, with an emphasis on correctness, performance, and long-term maintainability.

My development philosophy emphasizes:
- Clean, maintainable code  
- Clear architectural reasoning  
- Practical problem-solving  
- Continuous learning and technical depth  

I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to real projects, grow within a team, and continue building reliable, high-quality software.
