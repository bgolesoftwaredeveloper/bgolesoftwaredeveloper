# 👨‍💻 Systems-Oriented Software Engineer

I build correct, performant, and maintainable applications across web, API, desktop, mobile, and systems-level platforms, grounded in strong foundations in computer science, software architecture, and algorithm design.

My work emphasizes clear reasoning, scalability, and long-term reliability, informed by hands-on experience with algorithms, data structures, operating systems concepts, networking fundamentals, and low-level systems development. I am comfortable working across macOS, Linux, and Windows, including scripting and automation in batch-oriented environments.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to technically rigorous projects and grow within a strong engineering team.

## 🔄 Technical Evolution & Focus (2026)

I am currently undergoing a strategic shift in my technical stack to prioritize modern safety, developer ergonomics, and rapid delivery without compromising on system performance.

* **From C/C++ ➡️ Go:** Shifting my systems-level focus to **Go**. I am leveraging Go's efficient concurrency and the **Gin Gonic** and **Wails** framework to build lightweight, high-performance websites and desktop applications.
* **From Java ➡️ Kotlin:** Transitioning to **Kotlin** for backend and mobile development, prioritizing its null safety and modern functional paradigms.
* **Desktop & Web:** Actively specializing in the **Wails** (Go + Frontend) ecosystem for cross-platform desktop tools and modern Go web frameworks for scalable APIs.
