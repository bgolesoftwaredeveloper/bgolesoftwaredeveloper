### 🔐 Cryptography & Security Algorithms

I am currently studying and implementing foundational and modern **cryptography algorithms** from scratch, focusing on both **asymmetric (public-key)** and **symmetric encryption** standards.

These implementations emphasize **mathematical correctness**, **secure key generation**, and **algorithmic understanding** over library abstraction.

### 🔑 Symmetric Ciphers

- **AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard – Galois/Counter Mode)** – Authenticated encryption combining confidentiality and integrity.  
- **Blowfish** – Symmetric block cipher emphasizing speed and key-dependent substitution.  
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** – Historical symmetric block cipher implemented for educational analysis.  
- **Twofish** – Symmetric block cipher known for its flexibility, key-dependent S-boxes, and efficiency.  
- **RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)** – Stream cipher demonstrating key-scheduling and pseudo-random generation.  
- **ChaCha20** – Modern symmetric stream cipher designed for high-speed encryption and strong security; often used in authenticated encryption schemes like ChaCha20-Poly1305.

### 🛡️ Public-Key Cryptography

- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** – Public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission.  
- **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)** – Public-key signature algorithm based on elliptic curve cryptography.  
- **Schnorr Signature** – Digital signature scheme providing efficiency, provable security, and support for multi-signatures.

### 🧮 Hash Functions and Key Derivation

- **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)** – Cryptographic hash function producing 256-bit digests.  
- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** – Password-based key derivation using HMAC-SHA256 for secure key stretching.

### 📐 Primality Testing

- **AKS Primality Test** – Deterministic polynomial-time primality testing algorithm.  
- **Miller–Rabin Primality Test** – Probabilistic primality testing used for key generation.

### 🎯 Focus Areas
Modular arithmetic and prime number theory  
- Elliptic curve mathematics and key pair generation  
- Randomized key generation and entropy analysis  
- Message authentication codes (MACs)  
- Hash-based integrity validation  
- Cryptographic padding and block cipher modes  
- Secure password hashing and key derivation

These implementations serve as **educational explorations of cryptographic foundations**, combining **theoretical rigor** with **practical coding precision** in languages such as **C**, **Go**, **Java**, and **Python**.
